## Yo, What's This All About?

Vinyl Vault is a personal project ‚Äì a record collection tracking app built for vinyl heads like myself.  Inspired by the love of crate digging, the feel of wax in your hands, and the *need* to know exactly what bangers are in your collection, this app lets you catalog, organize, and explore your precious vinyl hoard.  Think Discogs, but tailored to *your* collection and built with code!

As an aspiring software developer. I wanted a project that combined my love for music (especially sample-worthy vinyl) with my growing coding skills.  Plus, let's be real, keeping track of records on a spreadsheet is straight-up *WHACK*!

## Features That'll Make You Say "Word?!"

*   **Add Records:**  Manually input record details (Artist, Title, Label, Year, Genre, etc.) or, if you're feeling fancy, integrate with the Discogs API to pull info automatically! (Future development, yo!)
*   **Browse Your Collection:**  Sort and filter your records by any field.  Find that rare groove you've been searching for in seconds.
*   **Detailed Record View:** See all the info about a record, plus add personal notes (e.g., "Killer sample on B2!", "Found this at a dusty shop in St. Pete").
*   **Wishlist:** Keep track of the records you're hunting for.  Never double-buy again!  (We've all been there...)
*   **Stats:** See cool stats about your collection (e.g., total records, most common genre, average year).  Bragging rights are important!
*   **User Authentication:** (Future Feature) Securely manage your collection and potentially share it with other users (if you're feeling generous).

## Tech Stack: The Tools of the Trade üõ†Ô∏è

This project is built using the following technologies:

*   **Frontend:** [HTML/CSS]
*   **Backend:** [Python/Flask]
*   **Database:** [TBD]
*   **Version Control:** Git (of course!)

Why these technologies? Well...

Hopefully I'll learn both backend (Python/Flask) and frontend (HTML/CSS) skills simultaneously. These technologies are widely used in the industry, giving me practical knowledge applicable to real-world projects. The simplicity of this stack ensures that I‚Äôll see results quickly, keeping me motivated.
By starting with these technologies, I'll build a strong foundation in web development while keeping things manageable and fun! Once I'm comfortable, I'll explore more advanced tools like Angular or React for frontend interactivity or Django for larger-scale backend projects.

## Future Development:  Where We're Headed üöÄ

Here are some features I'm planning to add in the future:
