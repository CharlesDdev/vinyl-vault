## Yo, What's This All About?

Vinyl Vault is a personal project ‚Äì a record collection tracking app built for vinyl heads like myself.  Inspired by the love of crate digging, the feel of wax in your hands, and the *need* to know exactly what bangers are in your collection, this app lets you catalog, organize, and explore your precious vinyl hoard.  Think Discogs, but tailored to *your* collection and built with code!

As an aspiring software developer. I wanted a project that combined my love for music (especially sample-worthy vinyl) with my growing coding skills.  Plus, let's be real, keeping track of records on a spreadsheet is straight-up *WHACK*!

## Features That'll Make You Say "Word Up!"

*   **Add Records:**  Manually input record details (Artist, Title, Label, Year, Genre, etc.) or, if you're feeling fancy, integrate with the Discogs API to pull info automatically! (Future development, yo!)
*   **Browse Your Collection:**  Sort and filter your records by any field.  Find that rare groove you've been searching for in seconds.
*   **Detailed Record View:** See all the info about a record, plus add personal notes (e.g., "Killer sample on B2!", "Found this at a dusty shop in St. Pete").
*   **Wishlist:** Keep track of the records you're hunting for.  Never double-buy again!  (We've all been there...)
*   **Stats:** See cool stats about your collection (e.g., total records, most common genre, average year).  Bragging rights are important!
*   **User Authentication:** (Future Feature) Securely manage your collection and potentially share it with other users (if you're feeling generous).

## Tech Stack: The Tools of the Trade üõ†Ô∏è

This project is built using the following technologies:

*   **Frontend:** [Angular]
*   **Backend:** [Python]
*   **Database:** [TBD]
*   **Version Control:** Git (of course!)

Why these technologies? Well...

* Angular's component-based architecture is like building with LEGO blocks‚Äîeach piece (component) represents a specific part of the app. This makes the code modular, reusable, and easy to maintain, which is perfect for me (a beginners learning to organize their projects efficiently). I'm also using Python for the backend because I'm learning Python and it's a great framework for building APIs.

## Installation: Getting Started is Easy Peasy

1.  Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/CharlesDdev/vinyl-vault.git`
2.  Install dependencies:
    1.	Angular Material: Install using `ng add @angular/material`
	  2.	HammerJS: For gesture recognition (included with Angular Material installation)
	  3.	Browser animations for Angular Material (included with Angular Material         installation)
	  4.	Moment.js: For date and time manipulation, install using `npm install --save moment`
	  5.	RxJS: Already bundled with Angular, no additional installation required
    
Additionally, you may need to include the following in your project:											  1.	Node.js and npm: For managing project dependencies
	  2.	Angular CLI: For creating and managing the Angular project structure
	  3.  Configure the database: \[*Instructions on setting up the database*]
	  4.  Run the application:  \[*Instructions on running the app - e.g., `python app.py`, `npm start`*]

## Contributing:  Let's Build Something Dope Together!

This is a personal project, but I'm always open to suggestions, bug reports, and contributions! If you're a fellow vinyl enthusiast, a coding ninja, or just someone who wants to help make this app better, feel free to:

*   Fork the repository
*   Submit pull requests with bug fixes or new features
*   Open issues to report bugs or suggest improvements

## Future Development:  Where We're Headed üöÄ

Here are some features I'm planning to add in the future:

*   **Discogs API Integration:**  Automatically import record data from Discogs.
*   **Mobile App:**  Take your collection on the go!
*   **Scanning:** Use your phone's camera to scan record barcodes and automatically add them to your collection.
*   **Sharing:** Share your collection with friends and other vinyl lovers.
*   **More Stats:** Dive deeper into your collection with even more detailed stats and visualizations.

## Shout Outs & Acknowledgements

*   Big ups to the open-source community for providing the tools and resources to make this project possible.
*   Respect to all the record stores out there keeping the vinyl culture alive.
