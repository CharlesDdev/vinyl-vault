## Yo, What's This All About?

Vinyl Vault is a personal project – a record collection tracking app built for vinyl heads like myself.  Inspired by the love of crate digging, the feel of wax in your hands, and the *need* to know exactly what bangers are in your collection, this app lets you catalog, organize, and explore your precious vinyl hoard.  Think Discogs, but tailored to *your* collection and built with code!

As an aspiring software developer. I wanted a project that combined my love for music (especially sample-worthy vinyl) with my growing coding skills.  Plus, let's be real, keeping track of records on a spreadsheet is straight-up *WHACK*!.

## Features That'll Make You Say "Word Up!"

*   **Add Records:**  Manually input record details (Artist, Title, Label, Year, Genre, etc.) or, if you're feeling fancy, integrate with the Discogs API to pull info automatically! (Future development, yo!)
*   **Browse Your Collection:**  Sort and filter your records by any field.  Find that rare groove you've been searching for in seconds.
*   **Detailed Record View:** See all the info about a record, plus add personal notes (e.g., "Killer sample on B2!", "Found this at a dusty shop in St. Pete").
*   **Wishlist:** Keep track of the records you're hunting for.  Never double-buy again!  (We've all been there...)
*   **Stats:** See cool stats about your collection (e.g., total records, most common genre, average year).  Bragging rights are important!
*   **User Authentication:** (Future Feature) Securely manage your collection and potentially share it with other users (if you're feeling generous).

## Tech Stack: The Tools of the Trade 🛠️

This project is built using the following technologies:

*   **Frontend:** [Angular]
*   **Backend:** [TBD]
*   **Database:** [TBD]
*   **Version Control:** Git (of course!)

Why these technologies? Well...

* I'm using Python for the backend because I'm learning Python and it's a great framework for building APIs.

## Future Development:  Where We're Headed 🚀

Here are some features I'm planning to add in the future:

*   **Discogs API Integration:**  Automatically import record data from Discogs.
*   **Mobile App:**  Take your collection on the go!
*   **Scanning:** Use your phone's camera to scan record barcodes and automatically add them to your collection.
*   **Sharing:** Share your collection with friends and other vinyl lovers.
*   **More Stats:** Dive deeper into your collection with even more detailed stats and visualizations.
